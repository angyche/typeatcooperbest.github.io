Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Let's do it again then, what the heck. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. This is the way you take out your flustrations.

You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Anything you want to do you can do here. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.
