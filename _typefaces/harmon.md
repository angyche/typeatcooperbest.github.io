    Designed for formal-but-expressive uses, Harmon combines inspiration from classical inscriptional letterforms with calligraphic flat-brush stylings to create an even and refined character with a twinge of personality.

    Harmon comes in seven roman weights, ranging from XLight to Black, all looking their best when used 14 points and up. Primarily for display purposes, Harmon features long tapered vertical strokes, gently flared serifs, and a few unexpected angles to keep  it interesting.
